        ## Quizzes and Badges

        Quizzes help you practice what you've learned,
        badges recognise practical demonstration of a skill.

        ### Quizzes

        There are 10 quizzes throughout the course,
        testing a range of knowledge across modules.

    - content: |

        All quizzes are compulsory, and you must achieve
        100% in all quizzes to earn the 10% grade.

      notes: |

        This is different from most courses, where quizzes are often worth a small percentage each.

        In this course each quiz is worth nothing individually, but achieving a 100% pass in every quiz will earn you the full 10% assigned to the quiz portion of the course assessment.

    - content: |

        Quizzes are done online, and you have
        unlimited tries to achieve 100%.

      notes: |

        The all-or-nothing approach is not intended to make passing the course difficult. It's to give you some additional motivation to practice, practice, practice.

        Quizzes can be taken an unlimited number of times. You must gain 100%, but you can take as long as you need to get there.

        ### Badges

        There are a variety of badges available
        across a range of modules.

    - content: |

        Badges are rewarded for demonstrating a specific skill,
        and are assessed by teaching staff during classroom time.

    - content: |

        You can choose to attempt a badge at any time,
        and you have unlimited tries to achieve it.

    - content: |

        Earning badges is mandatory, but you have
        some choice in **which** badges you earn.

      notes: |

        Badges are important as they verify that you are capable of specific skills. However, not everyone has the same strengths or interest areas, so the range of badges you earn from the various modules is up to you.


    - content: |

        You **must** earn every badge marked as "compulsory".
        These are spread across modules.

      notes: |

        Compulsory badges have been identified as the skills most sought after in graduates. Achieving the set of compulsory badges will give you a strong base set of skills to present to a potential employer or supervisor.

    - content: |

        You **must** also earn at least 10 additional "elective"
        badges of your choice from any combination of modules.

      notes: |

        This means that you do not have to achieve every badge. Instead, you should aim to achieve badges which you think will most benefit you.

        Every student will have different strengths, and your badges represent your skill set such that finding complementary skills in others should become easier.

    - content: |

        Completing all compulsory badges **and** 10 elective badges
        will earn you 10% of your final grade.

      notes: |

        As with the quizzes, badges are assessed collectively. No grade will be achieved if the required badges have not been completed, but the full 10% will be awarded upon achievement of all compulsory badges and 10 elective badges.

    - content: |

        ### Summary

        All quizzes = 10%

        All compulsory badges
        + 10 elective badges = 10%

        ## Peer Review

        Regular peer review helps you to practice giving
        and receiving feedback in a professional setting.

    - content: |

        Feedback from other students will not have an impact
        on your grade. Your reactions to their feedback is the focus.
